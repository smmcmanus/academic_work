REDMOND, WA—In what CEO Bill Gates called "an unfortunate but
necessary step to protect our intellectual property from theft and
exploitation by competitors," the Microsoft Corporation patented the
numbers one and zero Monday.

or selling products containing zeroes and ones—the mathematical
building blocks of all computer languages and programs—unless a
royalty fee of 10 cents per digit used is paid to the software giant.

"Microsoft has been using the binary system of ones and zeroes ever
since its glorious inception in 1975," Gates told reporters. "For years, in the
interest of the overall health of the computer industry, we permitted
the free and unfettered use of our proprietary numeric
systems. However, changing marketplace conditions and the decreasingly
predatory practices of certain competitors now leave us with no choice
but to seek compensation for the use of our numerals."
