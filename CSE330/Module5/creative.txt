Creative portion:
Share Events with add/reject option: Can share events with another user, but instead of sharing events directly, it will send other user a notification with an option to add or delete invitation.
Email: When registering, users will add in their email and the site will shoot them an email thanking them and explaining the calendar's basic functionality.
