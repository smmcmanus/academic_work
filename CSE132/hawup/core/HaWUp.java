	 * You must modify this method as described below.  Read this

	 * 
	 * Generates code to run a set of Tasks on the cluster.  
	 * The Tasks are placed and run on the cluster when the
	 *    returned Runnable's .run() is called.
	 * The software design name for the returned object is a "future"
	 * It is a computation that can be invoked later to accomplish
	 * its goals.
	 * 
	 * This code is given to you BUT our analysts have uncovered an
	 * insidious race that could cause this code to fail.  
	 * 
	 * Suppose somebody
	 *   1) Calls genJob and receives the resulting ResultRunnable
	 *   2) Then calls getResult() BEFORE the run() method was able
	 *         to set the job instance variable (*)
	 *   The result is a NullPointerException issued from getResult()
	 *     because job is null
	 *   
	 *   To fix this, you must use what you have learned in class so
	 *   that getResult() waits until the instance variable has been set.
	 *   The HaWUpTester tests for this!
	 *   ==============================================================
	 *   
	 *   (*) This can happen in one of two ways:
	 *     a)  getResult() is called but the run() method has not been called
	 *     b)  run() is called, but has not yet reached the assignment
	 *         to the instance variable.  There is a narrow window in
	 *         which getResult() could be called after run(), but the instance
	 *         variable has not been assigned.  To make that window more likely,
	 *         there is a sleep() call.
	 * 
	 * @param tp provides the tasks for the job
	 * @return a Runnable that when .run() actually enqueues the Tasks
